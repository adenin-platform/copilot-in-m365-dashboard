## Can Adenin help with configuring?

Some of the Cards in this package are updating themselves with the latest CoE resources for you. And others (e.g. Dashboard, Copilot QnA, Prompt Buddy, Workday, SuccesFactors, ServiceNow, Learning) need to be configured with your organization's SharePoint instance (for example to install the Prompt Buddy PowerApp or set up the relevant Viva Engage sites). Adenin can do this job for you, [just reach out](https://forms.microsoft.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=YcZMzgZFSE2MZMWwkKpG-1hGoYSsiA1AuSdSFitOj-xUN0wwMDRKRTBKTjVPWkRVR0hWUEZQR0FUNy4u) for a complimentary no-obgliation consultation and one of our experts can help you get your Copilot CoE off the ground.
