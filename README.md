## Is this free?

Yes, we designed this Copilot in M365 CoE dashboard to be a free one-stop-shop for all your Copilot news and resources. Some of the Cards in this dashboard are pulling live Microsoft data, for example from their blogs; but others are meant to be installed in your organization to work. [Simply speak to our team](https://forms.microsoft.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=YcZMzgZFSE2MZMWwkKpG-1hGoYSsiA1AuSdSFitOj-xUN0wwMDRKRTBKTjVPWkRVR0hWUEZQR0FUNy4u) who will be happy to give you a no-obligation consultation on how to properly deploy your Copilot CoE dashboard.

## Does it require Copilot for M365 licenses?

No, all you need is access to Viva Connections dashboard.

<h2 id="how">Can Adenin help with configuring?</h2>

Some of the Cards in this package are updating themselves with the latest CoE resources for you. And others marked with a 🔌 symbol (e.g. Dashboard, Copilot QnA, Prompt Buddy, Workday, etc.) need to be configured with your organization's SharePoint instance (for example to install the Prompt Buddy PowerApp or set up the relevant Viva Engage sites). Adenin can do this job for you, [just reach out](https://forms.microsoft.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=YcZMzgZFSE2MZMWwkKpG-1hGoYSsiA1AuSdSFitOj-xUN0wwMDRKRTBKTjVPWkRVR0hWUEZQR0FUNy4u) for a complimentary no-obgliation consultation and one of our experts can help you get your Copilot CoE off the ground.

## Where do I find these Cards after the installation?

You can find these Cards on your Viva Connections dashboard, which you can visit by going to `https://<your-sharepoint>.sharepoint.com//_layouts/15/vivahome.aspx` or `https://<your-sharepoint>.sharepoint.com/SitePages/Dashboard.aspx`

## Does this work in SharePoint or in MS Teams?

Yes, this CoE dashboard is built using Viva Connections, the dashboard UI underlying both SharePoint and Microsoft Teams.

## Will this overwrite my Viva Connections dashboard?

No, it is only adding new cards. If you install the package multiple times, it will only install those Cards that are not already there.

## I'm a security researcher. Can I build this package myself by cloning the repo?

Yes, this repo contains the entire source code. Either clone the repo and navigate your command line to `cd downloads/copilot-in-m365-dashboard`, or download the zipped version of the repo. Then execute `build.cmd` in your CLI to build the `cli.zip` archive from the source.

## Can I change what Cards I show to my users?

Yes, simply delete any Viva Cards or SharePoint web parts you don't need. If you later change your mind, simply re-run the installer.

## What permissions do I need to install this?

You will need to be a "Global Administrator" for your Microsoft 365 tenant. Just being a "SharePoint Administrator" only won't be a sufficient role for the installation.
